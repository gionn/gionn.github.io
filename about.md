My name is **Giovanni Toraldo** and I was born in [Lucca][lucca] (Italy).

I am an [Open Source][1] enthusiast with [SuperCow Powers][2], a
Java/Ruby/whatever developer, writer of the [OpenNebula 3 Cloud Computing][3]
[book][4].

I currently work as Solution Developer at [Engineering D.HUB][5],
developing the [ClouDesire][6] platform since the startup I co-founded in 2016.

During the weekends I shoot with a [medieval crossbow][7] for a reenactment association.

Feel free to reach me on LinkedIn (link in the footer) for working purposes, but
I am currently not open to any new working opportunities. My resume (CV) is
[here](/files/giovanni-toraldo-cv.pdf).
